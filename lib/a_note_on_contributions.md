### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

`paper 2`:Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment

In this project, Colin implement the algorithms according to paper on how to reduce bias in machine learning models by introducing equality constraints. 

First, the original data was read and preprocessed, one-hot encoding was implemented on the categorical features, and missing values were processed. Then, an unconstrained logistic regression model was constructed as a baseline. In order to evaluate the degree of deviation of the model, multiple indicators for measuring deviation are defined and implemented, such as Statistical Parity Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference, and Average Odds Difference. By analyzing these indicators, he found that the unconstrained model had certain bias problems. In order to obtain a relatively unbiased model, the innovative method of introducing equality constraints in the training process was proposed in the paper. For example, constraints such as Statistical Parity Constraint and Conditional Demographic Disparity were designed and implemented and incorporated into the model training process to reduce model deviations in sensitive attributes. In addition, Colin further optimized the model training method, taking all equality constraints into consideration and transforming it into a constrained optimization problem. By solving this optimization problem, he successfully obtained model parameters that satisfied multiple constraints and achieved comprehensive control of model deviations.
