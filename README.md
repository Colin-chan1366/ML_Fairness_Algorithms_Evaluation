# GR5243 Spring 2024 Applied Data Science
## Project 4 Machine Learning Fairness Algorithms Evaluation

In this project, working in teams, you will implement, evaluate and **compare** algorithms for **Machine Learning Fairness**.

   - Algorithm 1: Fairness Constraints: Mechanisms for Fair Classification
   
   - Algorithm 2: Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment


### Team:
   - Jianfeng Chen (Colin)
   - Yiwei Jiang
   - Tianyi Chen
   - Yinpei Wang

For presentation, each team should briefly explain 

+ what each algorithm does;
+ how the evaluation was carried out; 
+ and what are the main results.

#### Existing R/Python functions that can be part of your implementation. 

Unless otherwise instructed, you can use existing R/Python functions as part of your implementation. But, you'll be expected to write the main algorithm by yourself.
